## What's this, then?

An extremely na√Øve, [brutalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brutalist_architecture)
attempt at packaging up simple Lua (5.1) apps with all the stuff needed to
edit and build them.

```
git clone https://github.com/akkartik/teliva
cd teliva
make linux
src/teliva hanoi.teliva
```

Here's an example app (the [Tower of Hanoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi)):

<img alt='screenshot of Teliva running the Towers of Hanoi' src='doc/hanoi.png'>

The idea is that no matter what app you run, you are always guaranteed access
to a hotkey (currently `ctrl-e`) to edit its sources.

Save (`ctrl-s`) and quit (`ctrl-x`) to restart the app with the new sources.

Over time I hope to improve the experience for error messages, failing tests,
undoing changes and so on. The emphasis will be on maximizing hackability
rather than functionality. I plan to be extremely parsimonious in taking on
further dependencies. It should need just a Linux (or maybe some other Unix?)
kernel, a C compiler, 12kLoC of Lua in this repo, ncurses.

## Why Lua?

It's reputedly the fastest interpreted language per line of implementation
code.

## Will it run any Lua program?

Not quite. This approach doesn't make sense for batch programs, I think. I
also don't know how to obtain a simple, shallow Graphics stack, so there's no
support for graphics at the moment. Teliva initializes the ncurses library by
default, so apps should assume they have access to a text-mode window for
printing text to, and a keyboard for reading unbuffered keystrokes from.
Compare `hanoi.teliva` with `hanoi.lua` to get a sense for what changes are
needed. My plan is to disable support for certain Lua libraries as I gain
experience programming in this way.

I want to provide sandboxed access to system resources (file system, network,
etc.) which will likely create incompatibilities with the standard library.
I'm disinclined to try to &lsquo;improve&rsquo; on Lua syntax, however. It's
not my favorite, but it's good enough.

It's also not tested much yet. This is my first time programming either in Lua
or within Lua. Bug reports most appreciated.

## What's with the name?

Teliva is the Tamil root for &lsquo;clear&rsquo;. Very much aspirational.

# README for Lua 5.1

* What is Lua?
  ------------
  Lua is a powerful, light-weight programming language designed for extending
  applications. Lua is also frequently used as a general-purpose, stand-alone
  language. Lua is free software.

  For complete information, visit Lua's web site at http://www.lua.org/ .
  For an executive summary, see http://www.lua.org/about.html .

  Lua has been used in many different projects around the world.
  For a short list, see http://www.lua.org/uses.html .

* Availability
  ------------
  Lua is freely available for both academic and commercial purposes.
  See COPYRIGHT and http://www.lua.org/license.html for details.
  Lua can be downloaded at http://www.lua.org/download.html .

* Installation
  ------------
  Lua is implemented in pure ANSI C, and compiles unmodified in all known
  platforms that have an ANSI C compiler. In most Unix-like platforms, simply
  do "make" with a suitable target. See INSTALL for detailed instructions.

* Origin
  ------
  Lua is developed at Lua.org, a laboratory of the Department of Computer
  Science of PUC-Rio (the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro
  in Brazil).
  For more information about the authors, see http://www.lua.org/authors.html .

# README for Kilo

Kilo is a small text editor in less than 1K lines of code (counted with cloc).

A screencast is available here: https://asciinema.org/a/90r2i9bq8po03nazhqtsifksb

Usage: kilo `<filename>`

Keys:

    CTRL-S: Save
    CTRL-Q: Quit
    CTRL-F: Find string in file (ESC to exit search, arrows to navigate)

Kilo does not depend on any library (not even curses). It uses fairly standard
VT100 (and similar terminals) escape sequences. The project is in alpha
stage and was written in just a few hours taking code from my other two
projects, load81 and linenoise.

People are encouraged to use it as a starting point to write other editors
or command line interfaces that are more advanced than the usual REPL
style CLI.

Kilo was written by Salvatore Sanfilippo aka antirez and is released
under the BSD 2 clause license.
